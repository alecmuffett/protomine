I've been doing a lot of thought about the REST interface, notably how
there is no means to create or update (say) the objectTags of an
Object without rewriting ALL the metadata of the object.

This is partly a simplicity thing, and partly a REST amd security
thing, and partly a laziness thing.

The simplicity is obvious: create or update a whole Thing's metadata
is trivial to implement.  Having created the "CREATE" code, then the
"UPDATE" code is nearly the same.  Locking will be easy to fix.

The REST thing: I have vague and fuzzy concerns about people breaking
REST philosophy; I don't *think* letting people set a single parameter
of a thing will break REST - you're still idempotent, etc - but it
moves away from Things to Parameters-of-Things as being what is
manipulated by REST.  I am not in that headspace yet.

Security?  Just mention "TEST AND SET TIMERACE" to a security geek and
see what they say.

Finally there is the simplicity thing - what would the interface look
like?  I would like it to be generalised, maybe:

	/api/{object,tag,relation}/ID/param.xml
	CREATE -> ???
	READ -> get
	UPDATE -> set
	DELETE -> delete

Would CREATE and UPDATE be identical? Should they be separate?  Should
parameters auto-instantiate?
