Human User Interface URLs:

The protomine will also be equipped with a basic HTML user interface;
largely this can shadow the ReST API for fundamental operations, and
then can be extended out to provide extra functionality for the
protomine.

Later, "full" implementations are expected to implement tools and
plugins either on the server side, or as AJAX objects using the ReST
API, so the pure HTML user interface will gradually die out.

The pure HTML user interface is inherently limited to READ(GET) and
maybe CREATE(POST) operations, so commands that require UPDATE or
DELETE will need be faked with custom POST dialogues; thus we cheat
orthogonally by suffinxing API URIs with "/delete" etc, to make HTML
analogues.

Certain tasks need to be available to the user, which in "full" Mine!
implementations will be performed by sucking a JSON object from the
Mine, updating it and squirting it back up to the Mine; the pure HTML
Mine UI will not have that capability, so the "update" URLs of various
objects must provide them.
