#summary How to get the Protomine software, and how to install it on OSX/Linux/Solaris

This page changes too rapidly, so for the moment has been replaced by README-INSTALL.TXT in the code repository.  

Please see that document instead.

To get your own copy of the repository, please install one via:

{{{ cd ; svn checkout http://protomine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ protomine }}}
