#summary Discussion of the export-format for compliant Mines

= Introduction =

One of the precepts of The Mine! Project is that _you_ are hosting _your_ data.

Key to this is that when you choose to move your Mine! from one hosting provider to another, or onto a device like an iPhone or GooglePhone, or into or from cloud storage, you need a common format to simplify your life.

= Details =

  * a Mine! export file is a Zip file
  * rooted _under_ but not _containing_ the database directory
  * containing mandatory subdirectories
    * config
    * objects
    * relations
    * tags
  * containing optional subdirectories
    * anything else, at risk of deletion by the user

  * N is an integer string (eg: "42")
  * N is greater than zero

How to scale sensibly when N >= 100 ?
