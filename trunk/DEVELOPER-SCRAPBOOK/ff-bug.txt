I am running into the firefox double-get bug documented here:

  http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=3246092#3246092

and here:

  http://brian.pontarelli.com/2006/05/02/is-your-browser-requesting-a-page-twice/#comment-2100

and here:

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236858

which has the summary:

  Doubled page loads are usually due to one of two factors: 1)
  Mismatched character sets specified in the HTTP headers and in the
  HTML meta tags (triggering bug 236858), or 2) empty src attributes
  in img tags (which cause the browser to resolve theirs locations to
  the current URL, re-loading the page for each instance).

  OK, I just found the #3 cause for this, and here's a link to where I
  discovered it: [brian.pontarelli.com] When there's a "url()"
  specified in inline CSS, it triggers a second page load.

The doubled-get is breaking ReST because it deletes an object twice,
the first succeeds, the second fails, and the user is confused.  I am
watching the requests go past using the LiveHTTPHeaders plugin.


I am staring at my HTML below - I pulled a copy with 'curl' - and can't see what aspect of it might cause something like:

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236858#c9

  I also was suffering this problem with my cart.  I spent about 40
  minutes trying to fix it on the server side, and then I decided to
  check the request via LiveHTTPHeaders.  It was then I noticed that
  the file was being re-requested.  After a quick search on Bugzilla I
  found this bug, noticed that comments regarding the charset (I set
  one in the source, but not via HTTP Headers), and sent the charset
  via the headers. It now works fine.  The PHP code to send the
  charset via headers is header("Content-type: text/html;
  charset=ISO-8859-1"); if anyone is interested.

There must be something causing the double-get but I can't see it, unless charsets are case-sensitive and ISO-8859-1 != iso-8859-1 ?

Any ideas?
