Protomine is the first and reference implementation of The Mine Project. 

See http://themineproject.org/ for details; see also
http://code.google.com/p/jmine/ and http://code.google.com/p/pymine/
(both in planning)

Three Google Groups are in use:

* themineproject discussion

http://groups.google.com/group/themineproject /
themineproject@googlegroups.com

This is the general discussion group for mine software; it's not meant
to cover developer issues (that's for the "-devel" list) but should
cover all other mine software topics


* themineproject-devel

http://groups.google.com/group/themineproject-devel
/themineproject-devel@googlegroups.com

Developer list: for discussion of implementation-related issues,
protomine, pymine, jmine, scrapers, uploaders, APIs and the like.


* themineproject-announce

http://groups.google.com/group/themineproject-announce /
themineproject-announce@googlegroups.com

Announcments-only list (low traffic) - traffic here will be replicated
to the discussion list, if you're a member of that you don't need to
subscribe to this list.
