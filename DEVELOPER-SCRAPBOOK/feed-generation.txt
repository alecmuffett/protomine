Feed Generation

Version 1.0 of the algorithm for feed generation is:

1) consider a relationship/feed for someone named "Perry"

2) for Perry, extract the list of "inclusive" and "exclusive" tags
   which are associated with that relationship, for instance:

	INCLUSIVE TAGS: "wine", "women", "song", "hippos"

	EXCLUSIVE TAGS: "not:white-wine" 

3) for each and every object in the database, extract the list of tags
   that are associated with the object.

4a) if the object lacks status:published, move on

4b) if any of those object tags match the list of Perry's inclusive
    tags then CONSIDER INCLUDING the object in the feed.

4c) if any of those object tags match the list of Perry's exclusive
    tags (eg: "white-wine" matches Perry's "not:white-wine") then
    RESCIND ANY CONSIDERATION OF INCLUDING the object in the feed.

4d) if any of those object tags are explicitly "for:perry", then
    ABSOLUTELY INCLUDE the object in the feed, irrespective of the
    above considerations.

4e) The feed will contain any objects which are absolutely included,
    and any for which consideration was not rescinded.
