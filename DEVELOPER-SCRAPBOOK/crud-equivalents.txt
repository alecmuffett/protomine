ReST CRUD Mappings to HTTP methods:

	CREATE (POST)
	READ (GET)
	UPDATE (PUT)
	DELETE (DELETE)

PUT can be faked via POST of a http-uri-encoded object with:

	"_method" set to "POST"

	"_data" set to the object data (TBD)

	"_type" set to the content-type of the PUT request; given the
	"update" nature of the fake PUT, this latter MAY be ignored by
	the server, but clients MUST send it.

DELETE can be faked via POST of a http-uri-encoded object with:

	"_method" set to "DELETE"
