comments on objects get written as key=value files in
database/objects/OID.comments/CID

	NB COMMENTS NEED A SUBMISSION CGI FORM THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO
	THE PUBLIC.  HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO THE PRIVACY OF THE MINE?


	GET     /ui/submit/OID.html  <- PUBLIC <- get form to insert comment
	CREATE  /api/submit/OID.xml  <- PUBLIC <- insert comment

	CREATE  /api/object/OID/comment.xml <- NOT PUBLIC BUT SAME AS submit/OID.xml
	READ    /api/object/OID/comment.xml
	READ    /api/object/OID/comment/CID.xml
	UPDATE  /api/object/OID/comment/CID.xml
	DELETE  /api/object/OID/comment/CID.xml
