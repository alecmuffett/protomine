General installation: (ALL PLATFORMS)

Protomine requires the Perl JSON::XS and HTML::Template modules, which
are probably most easily installed by performing the following as
root:

	sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON::XS'

	sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install HTML::Template'

(Use "su" and skip using "sudo" on platforms where that's inappropriate)

On OSX I had to go repermission some of the contents of
/Library/Perl/5.8.8/ (and subdirectories) because the CPAN build set
up JSON::XS and HTML::Template set no group- or world read/execute
permissions.  

This bug manifested itself as protomine failing to run as an Apache
CGI script, claiming that (eg:) JSON::XS did not exist / could not be
found, when in fact it *was* installed but running as the "www" user
(as a CGI script launched by Apache) it was unable to access

  /Library/Perl/5.8.8/JSON/darwin-thread-multi-2level/JSON/XS

...which was owned by "alecm" and mode 0700

I presume other platforms risk the same problem.
