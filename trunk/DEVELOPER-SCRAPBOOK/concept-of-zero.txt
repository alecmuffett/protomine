The Thing database system numbers all things as sequences of positive
integers from 1 upwards.

This means that Thing number zero/0 is illegal, a bit like a NULL
pointer or a NUL byte at the end of a C-string.

The protomine implementation uses this concept:

1) A minekey encodes the following information:

	magic,RID,RVSN,OID

   if OID is zero, the feed for relation RID is returned, so long as
   the relation version RVSN matches the RID's current version number
